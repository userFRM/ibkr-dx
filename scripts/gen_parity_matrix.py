"""One table: every call the TWS API names, and which client carries it.

This client exists to be put where a gateway was, so the question a reader
actually has is not "what can it do" but "is anything I use missing". A page
that describes only this client cannot answer that. A row per call, a column
per client, and a mark in each, can.

Every column is read from the client it names — not recalled, not asserted:

  TWS API     the canonical list this repository already generates, which is
              IBKR's own Python client's surface
  ibapi       that client, imported and enumerated
  ib_async    the widely used asynchronous client, imported and enumerated
  ibkr-dx         this client, from the coverage matrix the build already checks

A column can only be written for a client that is installed. One that is not
is left out of the table entirely rather than filled with guesses, and the page
says which were read and at what version.
