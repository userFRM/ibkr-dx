"""An option set for a gateway that is not there is said, not swallowed.

The reference client hands these to its gateway on the greeting, and each one
changes how the session behaves — how fast it may ask, what it is told. There
is no gateway between this client and the venue to read them. A caller who set
one and heard nothing has a session that is not the one they asked for, and no
way to find that out.
