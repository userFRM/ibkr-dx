"""The map of open quote subscriptions is read under the same guard it is
written under.

The wheel is free-threaded, so a subscription opened or withdrawn on one
thread really does resize this map while another thread is scanning it for a
contract's quote. Scanned unguarded, a plain quote read raised
`RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration` on the reading
thread — which is neither the thread that changed anything nor a failure the
caller can do anything about.
