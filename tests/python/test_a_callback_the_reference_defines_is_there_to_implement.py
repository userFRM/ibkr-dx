"""A callback the reference client defines exists here, even where it never fires.

Nine of them cannot fire on this connection and each says why: there is no
terminal to make a verification handshake with, no socket layer of the reference
client's own to report a Windows error from, and nothing on this wire has been
seen to state a rerouted contract. But a program written against that client
implements them, and a callback that is not there is a port that does not run —
so they are there, and silent, rather than missing.
